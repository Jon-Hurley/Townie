# Townie
Code repository for the app Townie.


I recommend you use Visual Studio. It has good github integration and is a pretty light code editor with lots of extensions!

If you do not have Node installed, download it here: https://nodejs.org/en/

To get svelte working:

cd townie
npm install
npm run dev

Source: https://svelte.dev

To get django working:

cd django-townie

pip install pipenv

pipenv shell

pipenv install django

cd backend

python manage.py migrate

python manage.py runserver
